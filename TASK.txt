1) add Q > 50 linADC criteria for each cell in ref run
2) implement purity and stability for monitoring of overal run quality and distinguish drift from fluctuations
3) implement plot for time evolution of cells of interest within runs of interest
4) implement high_threshold and low_threshold to distinguish drift from faults
